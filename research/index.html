	<h1>Buoyancy Driven Entrainment</h1>
	<p>The mechanism of entrainment has long been thought to originate from turbulent eddies. There are some flows however, where entrainment persists even in the laminar regime. “Thermals”, or regions of isolated buoyant fluid thought to be the basic unit of convection (Yano, 2014), were recently found to vary by less than 20% in laminar (Re=630) and turbulent (Re=6300) simulations in a dry atmosphere (Lecoanet and Jeevanjee, 2018). We derive a simple model that explains and reproduces these results.</p>
