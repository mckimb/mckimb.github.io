	<h2>Buoyancy-Driven Entrainment</h2>

	<p>The mechanism of entrainment has long been thought to originate from turbulent eddies. There are some flows 
		however, where entrainment persists even in the laminar regime. “Thermals”, or regions of isolated buoyant 
		fluid thought to be the basic unit of convection (Yano, 2014), were recently found to vary in entraining 
		rates by less than 20% in laminar (Re=630) and turbulent (Re=6300) simulations in a dry atmosphere 
		(Lecoanet and Jeevanjee, 2018). We derive a simple formula that reproduces these 
		results. We then demonstrate that by removing gravity midway through a simulation, the entrainment rate 
		drops dramatically, giving direct evidence of the central role of buoyancy in entrainment. See
